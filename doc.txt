Relationships
Products and Categories: One-to-many relationship where each product belongs to one category, and a category can have multiple products.
Customers and Orders: One-to-many relationship where each customer can place multiple orders, but each order belongs to only one customer.
Orders and Order Items: One-to-many relationship where each order can have multiple order items, but each order item belongs to only one order.
Products and Reviews: One-to-many relationship where each product can have multiple reviews, but each review belongs to only one product.
Additional Considerations
Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication for customers and potentially staff members accessing the system.
Payment Integration: Handle payment details securely and possibly integrate with payment gateways.
Inventory Management: Track stock levels and handle inventory updates based on orders.
Data Integrity: Ensure data consistency through foreign key constraints and appropriate indexing for efficient querying.
